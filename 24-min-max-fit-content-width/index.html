    1. min-content
      When we set width: min-content, we're specifying that we want our element to become as small as the longest word. This is a totally different perspective: we aren't sizing based on the space made available by the parent, we're sizing based on the element's children!

    2. max-content
      The max-content sizing keyword represents the maximum intrinsic size of the content. For text content this means that the content will not wrap at all even if it causes overflows.

    3. fit-content:
      The fit-content keyword is equivalent to fit-content(stretch). In practice, this means that the box will use the available space, but never more than max-content.
      If the content is too wide to fit in the parent, however, it adds line-breaks as-needed to ensure it never exceeds the available space. It behaves just like width: auto.
