      body {
        font-family: "wotford", sans-serif;

      h2 {

      /* Solution 1: Using width: max-content and max-width:100%

        max-content behaves similarly to fit-content, but for long items, it extends beyond the parent's width, causing
        horizontal overflow. What if we could use width: 100% to constrain it to the parent's width and prevent it
        from exceeding those bounds?

        This solution might seem to work as expected, but as we discussed in part 25 (width algorithms), when we apply
        margin-left to an element with max-width or width: 100%, the element will take the full width and after apply
        margin left on it, it will overflow; it won't adjust itself to the available width like width: auto does.

        Since fit-content does not suffer from this issue, we can not proceed with this solution.
      */

      /* Solution 2: Using display: inline-block

        The desired outcome can be achieved using inline-block if we consider its behavior. inline-block elements behave
        similarly to inline elements in that if the preceding element has space available, the subsequent inline-block
        element will occupy that space, just like inline elements. If there is no available space, the inline-block
        element will behave like a block element.

        However, we want the h2 element to retain its block-level behavior and not adjust like an inline element.

        We could solve this problem by wrapping each h2 in a div element, but that is a less elegant solution and would
        clutter our HTML with unnecessary div elements.

      /* Solution 3: display: table âœ…

        display: table causes elements to render using Table layout. This is the layout mode used by the <table> HTML tag.
        It's an alternative layout algorithm to flow layout or positioned layout.

        By default, tables will shrink to hold their contents, but are still block-level elements. This is exactly what we
        want in this case, though it is a bit of a hack; a table element expects to have table rows as children, not text.
      */

      /* Solution 4: min-width: min-content and max-width: max-content âœ…

        h2 {
          min-width: min-content;
          max-width: max-content;
        }

        Here's how this works:
        - We haven't changed the width property, and so it will remain at auto. Because h2 is a block-level element, it will
          grow and shrink to fit the parent container.
        - But, it can't grow above its max-width, which is equal to max-content. If our h2 only has a few characters, this
          might be a really small value, like 100px. By setting this value as max-width, we clamp the element so that it
          can't expand to fill the parent container.
        - What if there's enough content to fill the parent container? For example, suppose we have 1000px worth of content
          in a 500px boxâ€¦ Well, max-width doesn't have any effect in this case. Our element grows to fill the container
          (thanks to width: auto), and this total width is 500px, well below the 1000px limit set using max-width.
