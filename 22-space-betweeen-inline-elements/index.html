    <h2>Space betweeen inline elements</h2>
    <p>
      Browser add some extra space to inline elements. Browser treats inline
      elements as if they're typography. It makes sense that with text, you'd
      want a bit of extra space, so that the lines in a paragraph aren't crammed
      in too tightly.
    </p>

    <h3>Extra space because of white spaces</h3>
    <p>
      But there's another unrelated way that inline elements have a bit of extra
      spacing. Take a look at this example; notice that there are gaps between
      the 3 images:
    </p>
    <img
      src="https://picsum.photos/id/234/200/300"
      width="100"
      alt="Cat photo"
    />
    <img
      src="https://picsum.photos/id/234/200/300"
      width="100"
      alt="Cat photo"
    />
    <img
      src="https://picsum.photos/id/234/200/300"
      width="100"
      alt="Cat photo"
    />

    <p>
      The reason for this extra <strong>“magic space”</strong> is that the
      browser treats inline elements as if they're typography. It makes sense
      that with text, you'd want a bit of extra space, so that the lines in a
      paragraph aren't crammed in too tightly.
    </p>

    <h3>No extra whitespace</h3>
    <img
      src="https://picsum.photos/id/234/200/300"
      width="100"
      alt="Cat photo"
    /><img
      src="https://picsum.photos/id/234/200/300"
      width="100"
      alt="Cat photo"
    /><img
      src="https://picsum.photos/id/234/200/300"
      width="100"
      alt="Cat photo"
    />

    <p>
      This happens because HTML is space-sensitive, at least to an extent. The
      browser can't tell the difference between whitespace added to separate
      words in a paragraph, and whitespace added to indent our HTML and keep it
      readable.
