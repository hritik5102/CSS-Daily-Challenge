        Note: Please check and understand the problem in Example 01 before proceeding to the
        solution below.

        When the <html> element is given height: 100%, it takes up the full height of the viewport, serving as the base. The <body> element's 100% height is then calculated
        based on this base size.

        When we define the min-height for our section element, it ensures that the section is at least as tall as the viewport but can expand beyond that if the content requires
        more space.

        Applying height: 100% to the <body> element alone does not solve the issue because the same problem we saw earlier applies to the <html> element as wellâ€”it derives its height from the <body> height. If you inspect the elements in DevTools, you'll notice that even after applying height: 100% to the <body> tag, both <html> and <body> still have heights equal to the content height.

        Only after applying height: 100% to the <html> tag does it occupy the full viewport height. This then allows the <body> element to use it as a reference, and the section element can correctly apply min-height: 100%.
