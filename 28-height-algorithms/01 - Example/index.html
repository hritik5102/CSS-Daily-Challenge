          You might have noticed that even after setting the min-height of our section element to 100%, the content still doesn't occupy the full height of the viewport.

          This happens because when we set a percentage-based height, it is calculated relative to the height of the parent element. In this case, the parent is the <body> element, which does not have a specific height set. By default, the <body> only grows as much as necessary to contain its child elements. This means that the body's height is determined by its children content. As a result, the min-height we applied has no effect.

          To see this in action, open DevTools and inspect the <body> tagâ€”you'll notice that its height matches the height of its content.

          So, how can we solve this problem? We'll address it in our next example.
