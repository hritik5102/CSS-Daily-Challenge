## Height Algorithms


The default "width" behaviour of a block-level element is to fill all the available width, whereas the default "height" behaviour is to be as small as possible while fitting all of the element's content; it's closer to `width: min-content` than `width: auto`!

An element's width is calculated based on its parent's size, but an element's height is calculated based on its children.
